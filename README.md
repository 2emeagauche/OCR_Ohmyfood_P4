OpenClassRooms Project 4

Mobile first site.
The purpose is to choose a restaurant, compose a menu and passing the order
We have to compose the styles with sass and propose animations.

Specific menu animation cases

On restaurants pages we animate the dish buttons on page display.
The default case is to have 3 starters, 3 maincourses and 3 desserts.
The module "animations.scss" use map variables declared in "variables.scss".
The default case use "map.get(v.$starters-count, "sc3")", "map.get(v.$maincourses-count, "mc3")", "map.get(v.$desserts-count, "dc3")".

If the numbers of dishes is different:
As we don't use javascript we have to add a class to the parent block (".menu") to overwrite the default animation.
For instance "La note enchant√©e" has 4 starters so we add the class "count-s4-m3-d3"

The map variables allow a maximum of 5 dishes per courses and a minimum of 1.
If a restaurant has more than 5 dishes per courses then the variables.scss should be changed.
